# QGPTConversationPipeline

This model is specifically for QGPT Conversation pipelines, the model is used to group conversational prompts for instance a conversation around generating code.  here are some use cases- 1. contextualized_code_generation- This is for users that want to have conversations around generating code, when there is provided context. 2. generalized_code- This is for users that want to have conversations without context around code. 3. contextualized_code- This is for users that want to have conversation around code with Context. 4. contextualized_code_workstream: this is for the users that want to use context as well as LTME information in their chat (we will prioritize LTME information, but also support other info as well)
