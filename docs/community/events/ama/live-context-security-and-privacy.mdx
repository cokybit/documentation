# Under the Hood with Pieces: Deep Dive into the Security & Privacy of Long-Term Memory in Pieces Copilot+

> Live Stream Event - Tuesday, June 18, 12:00pm EST

> Note: Long-Term Memory is the new name for Pieces Live Context. You may still see this older name in our videos and documentation.

## üöÄ Event Overview {#event-overview}
Just two days after the [announcement of our Long-Term Memory feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP8u95RTCGE) in Pieces Copilot+, Microsoft announced their Copilot+ PC with ‚Äúphotographic memory‚Äù which ‚Äúhelps you remember things you may have forgotten‚Äù.

This launch unexpectedly brought many questions about the security and privacy of AI engines at the operating-system level, with many developers and organizations concerned about their sensitive data.

In this AMA (Ask Me Anything) live stream event, we‚Äôll be uncovering the tech behind our Long-Term Memory feature powered by the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTME) to showcase our commitment to air-gapped developer experiences, and discuss the benefits of an offline-first approach to using AI to remember the right things, not everything.

It was far from easy to develop this feature without relying on traditional cloud-based recording methods that can lead to security vulnerabilities, but ultimately we were able to create the LTME technology which works across all major operating systems, operates on-device and in real-time for extremely robust security and privacy, avoids network latency, liability of data, and expensive cloud costs, and enables developers to 10x their productivity.

Learn more about our development journey and what this means for your workflow by registering for the live stream!
