#### Search Your Saved Materials

You can search a saved material using `Pieces: Search`.

There are three main types of searching:

- **Fuzzy Search**: Fuzzy Search is a technique used to find matches that are likely to be relevant, even if they are not exact matches. It is particularly useful for handling typos, misspellings, and variations in data.

- **Full Text Search**: Full Text Search is a technique used to search for documents or records that contain the exact sequence of words in the search query. It indexes all the words in a document to enable fast and efficient searching.

- **Neural Code Search**: Neural Code Search is a technique that leverages neural networks and machine learning to improve the search and retrieval of code snippets. It allows you to use natural language to describe what you are looking for, capturing the semantics and context of the code to provide more accurate and relevant results.
